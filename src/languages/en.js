  presentantion: 'Scrum is an agile project management framework that aims for iterative and incremental value delivery. By utilizing self-organized teams, tasks are divided into short sprints, allowing for flexibility and adaptation to changes. The focus lies on constant collaboration among team members and transparency of activities. The Product Owner defines the backlog priorities, while the Scrum Master facilitates the process by removing obstacles and promoting continuous improvement. Daily Scrums and frequent Sprint Reviews ensure quality and efficiency in the work performed.',
  presentantionKanban: 'Kanban is a visual project management system that emphasizes workflow visualization and continuous improvement. It allows teams to visualize their work on a Kanban board, with cards representing tasks moving across columns from "To Do" to "Done." By limiting work in progress and focusing on flow efficiency, Kanban promotes a smooth and balanced workflow. With its emphasis on transparency and collaboration, Kanban enables teams to identify bottlenecks, optimize processes, and deliver value in a timely manner.',
